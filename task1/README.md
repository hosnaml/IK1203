Task 1: TCPAsk Client

In this task, I implemented a TCP client that connects to a remote server and retrieves data from it. The client sends a request to a specified server (e.g., time.nist.gov) and receives the server’s response. I focused on developing the TCPClient class, which establishes the connection to the server, sends a request, and displays the server’s response in a formatted output.

TCPAsk.java – An example Java program that uses the tcpclient.TCPClient class.
