Task 2: HTTPEcho Server

For this task, I built an HTTP server that listens for client connections and echoes back any data it receives, formatted as a valid HTTP response. The server processes incoming HTTP requests and sends the received content back in the response body with a “200 OK” status.

I implemented the server to handle incoming HTTP requests, parse the data, and send it back in a properly structured HTTP response.

TCPAsk.java – An example Java program that uses the TCPClient class.

TCPClient - Java TCP Client with Timeout, Shutdown, and Limit Features This Java class implements a TCP client that connects to a specified server and port, sends data, and receives a response. It supports:

Timeout handling – Stops reading if the server takes too long to respond.
Shutdown option – Allows closing the output stream after sending data.
Data limit enforcement – Restricts the amount of data received from the server.
The client reads data from the server into a buffer, ensuring it respects the timeout and data limit settings before closing the connection.
